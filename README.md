# Introduction

This is **extremely** rough and I'm just throwing it up now for those who want to try it out with the Eifel Grand Prix.

Trust me when I say there's stuff /everywhere/ and lots is illegible. It does stream tho!

You need to be a paid member of the F1TV Service (I really like it personally).

Big thanks to bbsan2k for their work on the [Kodi Plugin for F1](https://github.com/bbsan2k/plugin.video.f1tv).
